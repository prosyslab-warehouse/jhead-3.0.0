 This option causes files to be renamed and/ or mmoved using the date
 information from the Exif header "DateTimeOriginal" field.  If the file
 is not an Exif file, or the DateTimeOriginal does not contain a valid
-value, the file date is used.  Renaming is by default restricted to
-files whose names consist largely of digits.  This effectively restricts
-renaming to files that have not already been manually renamed, as the
-default sequential names from digital cameras consist largely of digits.
-Use the
-.B \-n
-option to force renaming of all files.  If the new name contains a '/',
+value, the file date is used.  If the new name contains a '/',
 this will be interpreted as a new path, and the file will be moved
 accordingly.
